            <h1>[COMPANY NAME]</h1>
            <h2>EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINARY POLICY AND CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">1. Objective and Rationale</div>
        <p>This policy establishes a fair, consistent, and clear framework for handling employee misconduct and promoting an orderly work environment. It aims to ensure that disciplinary actions are imposed in a manner compliant with the employee's **right to security of tenure** and the **due process** requirements mandated by the Philippine Labor Code (as renumbered), as implemented by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) rules.</p>

        <div class="section-title">2. Effective Date</div>
        <p>This policy is effective beginning **[Date of Implementation, e.g., January 1, 2026]**, and supersedes all previous disciplinary codes, rules, and procedures.</p>

        <div class="section-title">3. Salient Features</div>
        <ul>
            <li>**Management Prerogative:** The Company reserves the right to prescribe reasonable rules and regulations necessary for the conduct of its business and to impose disciplinary measures.</li>
            <li>**Principle of Proportionality:** The penalty imposed shall be **commensurate** to the gravity of the offense committed, giving due consideration to mitigating, aggravating, or analogous circumstances.</li>
            <li>**Due Process:** No employee shall be subjected to disciplinary action without first being accorded the right to **substantive** (just/authorized cause) and **procedural due process** (Twin Notice Rule and Ample Opportunity to be Heard).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-title">4. Eligibility</div>
        <p>This policy applies to **all employees** of [Company Name], regardless of their employment status (e.g., probationary, regular, contractual, or managerial).</p>
        
        <div class="section-title">5. Procedure for Imposing Disciplinary Action (Just Causes)</div>
        <p>Disciplinary action for offenses constituting a **Just Cause** under the Labor Code shall follow the **Twin Notice Rule**:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>**First Written Notice (Notice to Explain/Charge Sheet):** The Company shall issue a written notice to the employee, detailing the specific charges, acts or omissions constituting the offense, and the company rule or Labor Code provision violated. The employee shall be given **at least five (5) calendar days** from receipt to submit a written explanation, and to request a formal hearing/conference, if desired.</li>
            <li>**Ample Opportunity to be Heard:** After receipt of the explanation, or lapse of the period to explain, the Company shall conduct an investigation, and a hearing/conference if requested or deemed necessary to clarify factual issues.</li>
            <li>**Second Written Notice (Notice of Decision/Termination):** After due consideration of all evidence, including the employee's explanation, the Company shall issue a second written notice informing the employee of the final decision (e.g., dismissal, suspension, or exoneration). This notice must be served upon the employee.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="section-title">6. Preventive Suspension (Non-Punitive)</div>
        <p>An employee may be placed under **Preventive Suspension** (PS) if their continued presence poses a **serious and imminent threat** to the life or property of the employer or co-employees, or if it may interfere with the investigation. **It is not a penalty.**</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Duration:** The maximum period for PS is **thirty (30) calendar days**.</li>
            <li>**Extension:** If the investigation is not concluded within 30 days, the employee must be **reinstated** or the PS may be extended, provided that the extension is **with pay**, to avoid claims of constructive dismissal.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="section-title">7. Case Matrix and Sanctions</div>
        <p>Sanctions are generally progressive, but the Company retains the **discretion** to impose a heavier penalty, including immediate dismissal, for a first offense if warranted by the gravity of the violation, damage caused, or other aggravating circumstances (e.g., position of trust, prior offenses).</p>

        <div class="section-title">9. Prescriptive Period of Offenses</div>
        <p>Disciplinary action must be initiated by the Company within a reasonable time from the discovery of the offense to avoid the legal presumption of **condonation**.</p>
        <p>However, for guidance, the following periods shall be observed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**60 Days:** Minor Infractions (Group I).</li>
            <li>**90 Days:** Major Infractions (Group II).</li>
            <li>**120 Days:** Serious/Gross Offenses (Group III) not involving moral turpitude or crime.</li>
            <li>**365 Days:** Offenses resulting in financial damage or those subject to civil/criminal liability.</li>
            <li>**Imprescriptible Offenses (Group III):** Offenses that constitute a criminal act against the employer, its family, or representatives (**Commission of a Crime**), or those involving **Fraud** or **Willful Breach of Trust** (e.g., theft, falsification) where the underlying criminal/civil action has a longer prescriptive period. The Company shall be guided by the applicable laws in these cases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The period shall start from the date the offense was committed or the date the Company or its authorized representative was officially informed/discovered the offense.</p>

        <div class="section-title">10. Procedure for Termination (Just Cause Exception)</div>
        <p>The termination process, as detailed in Section 5 (Procedure for Imposing Disciplinary Action), is the standard procedure for all Just Causes under the Labor Code (Art. 297, as renumbered). No employee can be dismissed without the **Twin Notice Rule** being strictly observed.</p>
        <div class="note">**Exception to Progressive Sanction:** For Group III offenses such as **Serious Misconduct**, **Fraud**, **Willful Breach of Trust**, **Gross and Habitual Neglect of Duties**, or **Commission of a Crime**, the Company may impose the penalty of **Termination** on the first offense, consistent with the principle of proportionality and its right to protect its business interests.</div>

        <div class="section-title">11. Suppletory Application of the Labor Code</div>
        <p>In all matters not specifically covered by this policy, the applicable provisions of the **Labor Code of the Philippines (Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, and renumbered)**, its Implementing Rules and Regulations, and relevant DOLE Department Orders and jurisprudence shall apply in a **suppletory** manner.</p>
