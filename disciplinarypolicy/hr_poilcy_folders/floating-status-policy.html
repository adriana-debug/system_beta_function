                <!-- 1. PURPOSE -->
                <div class="section-title">1. Purpose</div>
                <p>This policy provides clear guidelines regarding the placement, treatment, compensation, and reassignment of employees under <strong>Floating Status</strong> within Digital Minds BPO. It ensures that employees’ rights are protected while operational requirements are managed responsibly and legally.</p>

                <!-- 2. SCOPE -->
                <div class="section-title">2. Scope</div>
                <p>This policy applies to all employees who may be temporarily without a campaign assignment due to client changes, account transitions, project ramp-downs, or other operational factors.</p>

                <!-- 3. DEFINITION OF FLOATING STATUS -->
                <div class="section-title">3. Definition of Floating Status</div>
                <p><strong>Floating Status</strong> refers to a temporary employment condition where an employee remains employed by the Company but currently has no assigned campaign or project. The employee is not terminated and remains part of the workforce while awaiting reassignment.</p>
                <p>During this period, employees are considered active and may be reassigned once a suitable position becomes available that matches their skills and qualifications.</p>

                <!-- 4. COMPENSATION -->
                <div class="section-title">4. Compensation</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Employees under Floating Status shall be compensated for the days they physically reported for work or rendered billable hours.</li>
                    <li>Floating Status does not entitle the employee to continuous daily compensation unless work was actually rendered.</li>
                    <li>Payouts will follow the standard company payroll schedule.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If an employee worked from the 1st to the 4th day of the month and entered Floating Status on the 5th, the compensation for the 1st to 4th will be processed and released on the regular payout date (e.g., the 20th).</p>

                <!-- 5. REASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES -->
                <div class="section-title">5. Reassignment to a New Campaign</div>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Skill Assessment:</strong> HR and Operations will review the skills, experience, and qualification profiles of employees under Floating Status.</li>
                    <li><strong>Matching with Available Campaigns:</strong> Employees will be prioritized for reassignment based on the alignment of their skills with available opportunities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Employee Initiative:</strong> Employees are encouraged to update their skill sets through training or certification programs to increase their reassignment prospects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Priority System:</strong> Those with the closest match to campaign requirements will be prioritized to ensure operational readiness and campaign success.</li>
                </ol>
