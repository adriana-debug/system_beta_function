                    <h2>EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINARY POLICY AND CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>
                </div>

                <div class="section-title">1. Objective</div>
                <p>This policy establishes a fair, consistent, and clear framework for handling employee misconduct and promoting an orderly work environment.</p>

                <div class="section-title">2. Rationale</div>
                <p>The policy ensures disciplinary actions are imposed in a manner compliant with each employee's <strong>right to security of tenure</strong> and the <strong>due process</strong> requirements mandated by the Philippine Labor Code (as renumbered) and DOLE rules. It also promotes transparency, predictability, and proportionality in sanctions to uphold trust across Digital Minds BPO.</p>

                <div class="section-title">3. Effective Date</div>
                <p>This policy is effective beginning <strong>[Date of Implementation, e.g., January 1, 2026]</strong>, and supersedes all previous disciplinary codes, rules, and procedures.</p>

                <div class="section-title">4. Salient Features</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Management Prerogative:</strong> The Company reserves the right to prescribe reasonable rules and regulations necessary for the conduct of its business and to impose disciplinary measures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Principle of Proportionality:</strong> The penalty imposed shall be <strong>commensurate</strong> to the gravity of the offense committed, giving due consideration to mitigating, aggravating, or analogous circumstances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Due Process:</strong> No employee shall be subjected to disciplinary action without first being accorded the right to <strong>substantive</strong> (just/authorized cause) and <strong>procedural due process</strong> (Twin Notice Rule and Ample Opportunity to be Heard).</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="section-title">5. Eligibility</div>
                <p>This policy applies to <strong>all employees</strong> of Digital Minds BPO, regardless of their employment status (e.g., probationary, regular, contractual, or managerial).</p>
                
                <div class="section-title">6. Procedure for Imposing Disciplinary Action (Just Causes)</div>
                <p>Disciplinary action for offenses constituting a <strong>Just Cause</strong> under the Labor Code shall follow the <strong>Twin Notice Rule</strong>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>First Written Notice (Notice to Explain/Charge Sheet):</strong> The Company shall issue a written notice to the employee, detailing the specific charges, acts or omissions constituting the offense, and the company rule or Labor Code provision violated. The employee shall be given <strong>at least five (5) calendar days</strong> from receipt to submit a written explanation, and to request a formal hearing/conference, if desired.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ample Opportunity to be Heard:</strong> After receipt of the explanation, or lapse of the period to explain, the Company shall conduct an investigation, and a hearing/conference if requested or deemed necessary to clarify factual issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Written Notice (Notice of Decision/Termination):</strong> After due consideration of all evidence, including the employee's explanation, the Company shall issue a second written notice informing the employee of the final decision (e.g., dismissal, suspension, or exoneration). This notice must be served upon the employee.</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="section-title">7. Preventive Suspension (Non-Punitive)</div>
                <p>An employee may be placed under <strong>Preventive Suspension</strong> (PS) if their continued presence poses a <strong>serious and imminent threat</strong> to the life or property of the employer or co-employees, or if it may interfere with the investigation. <strong>It is not a penalty.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The maximum period for PS is <strong>thirty (30) calendar days</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension:</strong> If the investigation is not concluded within 30 days, the employee must be <strong>reinstated</strong> or the PS may be extended, provided that the extension is <strong>with pay</strong>, to avoid claims of constructive dismissal.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="section-title">8. Case Matrix and Sanctions</div>
                <p>Sanctions are generally progressive, but the Company retains the <strong>discretion</strong> to impose a heavier penalty, including immediate dismissal, for a first offense if warranted by the gravity of the violation, damage caused, or other aggravating circumstances (e.g., position of trust, prior offenses).</p>

                <p>Disciplinary action must be initiated by the Company within a reasonable time from the discovery of the offense to avoid the legal presumption of <strong>condonation</strong>.</p>
                <p>However, for guidance, the following periods shall be observed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>60 Days:</strong> Minor Infractions (Group I).</li>
                    <li><strong>90 Days:</strong> Major Infractions (Group II).</li>
                    <li><strong>120 Days:</strong> Serious/Gross Offenses (Group III) not involving moral turpitude or crime.</li>
                    <li><strong>365 Days:</strong> Offenses resulting in financial damage or those subject to civil/criminal liability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Imprescriptible Offenses (Group III):</strong> Offenses that constitute a criminal act against the employer, its family, or representatives (<strong>Commission of a Crime</strong>), or those involving <strong>Fraud</strong> or <strong>Willful Breach of Trust</strong> (e.g., theft, falsification) where the underlying criminal/civil action has a longer prescriptive period. The Company shall be guided by the applicable laws in these cases.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The period shall start from the date the offense was committed or the date the Company or its authorized representative was officially informed/discovered the offense.</p>
