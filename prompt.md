You are given demo webpage source code (HTML, CSS, JS). 
Your task is to clean the code by:
- Removing developer signatures, author names, credits, watermarks, and personal identifiers
- Stripping inline comments or metadata that reference specific developers or organizations
- Eliminating any branding or attribution text not essential to the layout

Then, replace the demo content with **context relevant to internal BPO business tools**, such as:
- Employee attendance dashboards
- Daily time records
- Call center performance metrics
- Onboarding and training portals
- Retention and support campaign tracking
- Productivity and compliance monitoring

Do not remove or alter:
- Page structure (header, footer, navigation, content sections)
- Typography rules (font sizes, weights, hierarchy)
- Color schemes and visual styles
- Layout grids, spacing, and alignment
- Interactive behaviors (hover states, scrollable areas, fixed headers/footers)

Output a cleaned version of the code that contains only the structural layout and UI/UX rules, with demo placeholders replaced by **BPO-relevant internal tool context**. 
Ensure the code remains valid, functional, and minimal.
